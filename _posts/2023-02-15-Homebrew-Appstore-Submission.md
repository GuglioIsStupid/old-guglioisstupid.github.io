Well Guys, I have decided to do it, i have submitted Rit to 4TU Homebrew Appstore (Nintendo Switch only)!
I have been working on this for a while now, and I am glad to finally be able to submit it to the Homebrew Appstore!
I really hope it gets accepted, and I hope you guys enjoy it!

#### Code of the blog

```lua
for i = 1, 100 do
  print("I hope Rit gets accepted!")
end

math.randomseed(os.time())
local ritAccepted = math.random(1, 2) == 1

if ritAccepted then
  print("Yay! Rit got accepted!")
else
  print("Aww, Rit didn't get accepted :(")
end

```
