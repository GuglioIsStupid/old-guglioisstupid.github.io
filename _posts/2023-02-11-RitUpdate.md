Since that video is FUCKED!!!! Here is a link to the videos download url: [https://github.com/GuglioIsStupid/guglioisstupid.github.io/raw/main/assets/ritupdate-holdnotes.mp4](https://github.com/GuglioIsStupid/guglioisstupid.github.io/raw/main/assets/ritupdate-holdnotes.mp4)

I was FINALLY able to understand how to do actual holdnotes, so instead of the UGLY ðŸ¤¢ðŸ¤® hold notes i had before, i have a better improved version now! Check it out! (Or don't, it's not like I care or anything)

#### Code of the blog

```lua
print("sorry :( I didn't make anything goofy this time") -- Next time I'll make something goofy!!
```

#### Other stuff

I'm not sure what to put here, so I'll just put a random image here:
